          <p>Star light, star bright,
            first star I see tonight.
            I wish I may, I wish I might,
            have the wish, I wish tonight.
            We'll make a wish, and do as dreamers do,
            and all our wishes (all our wishes),
            will come true.
            
            When you wish, upon a star
            Makes no difference who you are
            Anything your heart desires will come...to...you.
            
            [JIMINY CRICKET]
            Pretty, huh? I'll bet a lot of you folks don’t believe that, about a wish coming true, do ya? We'll I didn’t either.
            Course, I’m just a cricket, but lemme tell you what made me change my mind.
            You see, the most fantastic, magical things can happen, and it all starts with a wish!
            
            (Tinker Bell flies down)
            
            If your heart is in your dreams,
            
            [CINDERELLA]
            I wish...I could go to the ball
            
            [SNOW WHITE]
            I'm wishing...someday, my prince will come
            
            No request is too extreme,
            
            [ARIEL]
            Ha-ha. I wish...Ohh...I wish I could be part of that world
            
            [PETER PAN]
            I wish...we'd never have to grow up. Off to Neverland, ha-ha
            
            When you wish upon a star,
            As dreamers do.
            
            [PINOCCHIO]
            Look Jiminy, someday I wish I could be a real boy

            JIMINY - You know, any wish is possible.
            All it takes is a little courage, to set it free
            
            (music)
            
            [JIMINY]
            A wish is a powerful thing, especially when it comes from the heart.
            
            Fate is kind.

            The sweet fulfilment of their secret longing.

            Just remember, always let your conscience be your guide.
            Let your conscience be
            your guide…let your conscience be your guide…
            
            [SNOW QUEEN]
            Slaves in the magic mirror, come from the farthest space.
            Through wind and darkness, I summon thee.
            Let me see thy face.
            A blast of wind, to find my fate.
            A thunderbolt, to cast my spell.
            Alas, grant me my wish as well.
            HaHaHaHaHa
            
            [JIMINY]
